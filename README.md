The application has been designed as my pet-project to use in practice all the power of modern libraries and best practices. It  receives data from the Github in JSON format through the Github REST-API and with the help of the Retrofit. Information about foods is fetched from United States Department of Agriculture by their cloud API. All data is stored in a database by the GreenDao ORM framework. Users can input any own recipes, fetch information from the cloud about foods and upload any photos from the internet by the Glide framework.
